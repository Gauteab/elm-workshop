# Elm workshop

In this workshop you will work on an existing Elm app, and add features to the app,
as you learn different techniques that are used in real world Elm apps.

The app you will be working with displays articles.
Your job will be to implement comments on the articles.

## Setup

Clone the repo using the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/akselw/elm-workshop.git
```

This will create a directory called `elm-workshop`. Navigate to the directory:

```
cd elm-workshop
```

The app uses `npm`. Intall dependencies using the following command (don't use `npm install`):

```
npm ci
``` 

Start the app:

```
npm start
```

You should now see the following in your terminal:

![alt text](/book/npm-start.png "Result of `npm start`")

And if you go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser,
you should see a working app. 

To get started, jump to Task 1.
