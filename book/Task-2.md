# Task 2 - Sending the comment to the server

We are now able to view and update a string,
containing the text that a user wants to comment on the article.
But commenters also want _other people_ to view their comments,
so we therefore have to send the comments in the model to the server,
so that it can be stored there, and served to other users.

Before we start with sending the comment to the server,
we will change how we represent our comment in the model,
so that we allow for all the states we plan to implement.

## Task 2.1: A custom type for new comments

##? Task 2.2: Making a request to the server
